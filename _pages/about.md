Hello, I’m **Youmei Fan** (范优美), an Assistant Professor of [Software Engineering Laboratory](https://naist-se.github.io/ja/) at the [Nara Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.naist.jp/).  

My research lies in *Empirical Software Engineering*, with a primary focus on *OSS ecosystems*. I study how developers collaborate, how their contributions evolve and sustain over time, and how financial and social dynamics influence participation in these communities. By combining large-scale data analysis with *socio-technical* perspectives, I aim to deepen our understanding of developer behavior and the sustainability of software as essential research infrastructure.  

I am also interested in *AI4SE*, particularly in exploring how developers interact with large language models and how these tools reshape collaboration and practices in software development.
