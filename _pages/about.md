Hello! I'm **Youmei Fan** (范优美), a Assistant Professor at Nara Institute of Science and Technology. 

I am a researcher in Empirical Software Engineering with a focus on OSS ecosystems. My research investigates how developers collaborate, how their contributions evolve and are sustained over time, and how financial and social factors influence participation within these communities. By combining large-scale data analysis with socio-technical perspectives, I aim to advance our understanding of developer behavior and the sustainability of software as critical research infrastructure. I am also interested in AI4SE, particularly in investigating how developers interact with large language models and how these tools shape collaboration and practices in software development.
